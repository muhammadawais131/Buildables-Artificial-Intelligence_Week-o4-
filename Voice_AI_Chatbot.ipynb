        "Bot: For Akshay's creation, here's a two-line definition of Assembler:\n",
        "\n",
        "An Assembler is a type of programming language that translates assembly code, which is a low-level and symbolic representation of machine code, into machine code that a computer's processor can execute directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "In other words, an Assembler is a programme that converts the human-readable assembly code written by programmers into the binary machine code that a computer's processor understands and executes.\n",

        "🤔 Thinking...\n",
        "Bot: Here are two benefits of using Artificial Intelligence (AI):\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Improved Efficiency**: AI can automate repetitive tasks and processes, freeing up human resources to focus on higher-value tasks and improving overall productivity and efficiency.\n",
        "2. **Enhanced Decision Making**: AI can analyze vast amounts of data and identify patterns, making it an effective tool for decision-making in areas such as healthcare, finance, and transportation, leading to better outcomes and reduced risk.\n",

        "You: perfect should you remember what was my first question\n",
        "🤔 Thinking...\n",
        "Bot: Your first question was: \"hey can you tell me the definition of artificial intelligence in just two lines\"\n",
        "Listening...\n",
        "You: amazing amazing so do you tell me what we discuss so for\n",
        "🤔 Thinking...\n",

        "1. You asked me to create a definition for the term \"assembler\" (for Akshay's creation).\n",
        "2. I provided a two-line definition of Assembler and explained its function.\n",
        "3. You asked me to list two benefits of using Artificial Intelligence (AI), which I provided.\n",
        "4. You confirmed that this was perfect.\n",
        "5. You then asked me to recall your first question, which I attempted to do (although it seems I made a slight mistake - you asked for \"assembler\" definition, not AI).\n",
        "6. Lastly, you asked me to summarize our conversation so far, which I've just done.\n",
